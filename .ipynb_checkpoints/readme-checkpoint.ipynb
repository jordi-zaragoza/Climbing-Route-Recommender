    "# Climbing Route Recommender\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository recommends sports-climbing routes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "I created a route recommender based on the features of the routes. I also created an app using this recommender, you can find it online on [this link](www.google.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notebooks\n",
    "`src/1.get_routes_table.ipynb` - Where I get routes table by cleaning and playing with the ascents table\n",
    "`src/2.clustering_routes.ipynb` - Where I apply Knn model to cluster the routues by their features\n",
    "`src/3.routes_rating.ipynb` - Where I get the routes global rating from different features\n",
    "`src/4.route_recommender.ipynb` - Where I define the route recommender\n",

    "`src/climber_class.py` - User class\n",
    "`src/location_class.py` - Class for the location\n",
    "`src/text_processor_class.py` - It contains sentiment, language recognition, word matching and cleaning. \n",
    "`src/grades_class.py` - Used for the class conversor\n",

    "- Streamlit\n",
    "1. `src/app.py` - The app in streamlit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section I explain the whole process. You can find the notebook files on the `src/` folder numbered, so it will be easier to follow. In the end of this document there is a diagram explaining the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Table\n",
    "In order to obtain the routes list features I took an 'ascents table' and converted it into a 'routes table'. For that purpose I had to:\n",
    "1. String cleaning for each column (using class `text_processor_class.py`)\n",
    "2. Sentiment (first checks language and then if comments are positive or negative, using class `text_processor_class.py`)\n",
    "3. Splitting\n",
    "4. Cleaning and filtering outlayers\n",
    "5. Adding climbers table features (this table was obtained from ascents table as well, how to in [this project](https://github.com/jordi-zaragoza/Climbing-Data-Analysis))\n",
    "6. Clean and group naming (it compares names and replaces if they are alike, using class `text_processor_class.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "I separated the features in 3 types:\n",
    "1. Independent features - I created groups or clusters using Knn modeling and visualized using PCA. Every route was asigned to a cluster.\n",
    "2. Rate features - These features were analyzed using PCA and finally mixed into a single feature that will sort the cluster option\n",
    "3. User features - - These ones are defined by user and are used as a filter. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommender\n",
    "With the final table I was able to create a recommender based on new user features and climbed routes. I created an app to make it easier and more user friendly. You can input the climber information and the recommender will output the recommended routes per region, cluster and ordered by rating.\n",

    "## Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "- This repository uses 3 different databases. Users, ascents and grades.\n",
